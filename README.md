# **Customer Segmentation Analysis Using Clustering Techniques**

This project performs customer segmentation on a retail dataset to identify distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior. By leveraging clustering techniques such as K-means and DBSCAN, this analysis helps to uncover customer patterns and behaviors that can be used for targeted marketing and personalized strategies.

## **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviors using clustering techniques like K-means and DBSCAN. This segmentation allows businesses to target specific customer groups for better marketing and product strategies, increasing customer engagement and sales efficiency.

## **Project Structure**

- **Dataset**: Retail dataset containing customer purchasing behaviors, such as transaction details, product categories, and demographic information.
- **Technologies Used**: 
  - Python
  - Pandas, Numpy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - DBSCAN, K-means clustering
  
## **Key Steps**

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Loaded the retail dataset and handled missing values.
   - Performed encoding and scaling on relevant features for clustering.
   
2. **Clustering Analysis**:
   - **K-Means Clustering**: Implemented K-means clustering to segment customers. Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
   - **DBSCAN Clustering**: Optionally applied DBSCAN clustering for identifying dense regions of customers.
   - Evaluated clusters using the Silhouette Score to validate performance.
   
3. **Segment Analysis**:
   - Analyzed the characteristics of the clusters to identify distinct customer behaviors and patterns.
   - Visualized clusters to understand segment distribution.

4. **Results & Insights**:
   - Created actionable customer segments based on purchasing behavior.
   - Provided insights on how businesses can target specific customer segments to enhance marketing and sales strategies.
